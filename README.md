# Infralast | Supply Chain Network Design Tool

Welcome to **Infralast**!

This is an open source tool being designed to support you to 
add more intelligence power into operations wherever you go.

 This tool was created by Bautista Coronado, leveraging in 
 previous programs created by Michael Watson for educational 
 purposes in the book [Supply Chain Network Design](http://networkdesignbook.com/).
 
Infralast, in particular, is a result of our intention of
*Empowering people to make data based decisions through 
the usage of simple tools with low entrance barriers*.

In this github, you will find our main optimization tool: [IntegratedOptimization.ipynb](https://github.com/bauticoro/network_design_tool/blob/main/IntegratedOptimization.ipynb)
And you will find [data folder](https://github.com/bauticoro/network_design_tool/tree/main/data) which stablishes the input data schema to make this tool work. 
It is important not to change the first row of each file, neither the order of the columns.

Contributions and constructive feedback are very welcome. 
Please [Reach out](bauticoro@gmail.com) to us.

### How to setup my specific case
Its recommended to use this tool after reading [Supply Chain Network Design Book](http://networkdesignbook.com/), which introduces many concepts useful to do a successfull design.
Once doing that, you will find the first module of the Jupyter Notebook Script where you can manage the different parameters to work with.

### How to open a Jupyter Notebook
1. Install the necesary programs by clicking [here](http://networkdesignbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Steps-to-install-Python-Anaconda-and-PuLP-and-plotly-packages.pdf)
2. To open Jupyter in Windows, go to the search bar at the bottom left and type in Juypter… and you should see the Juptyer note books
3. Juptyer Notebooks will open in your browser.  Just navigate to the folder where you downloaded [IntegratedOptimization.ipynb](https://github.com/bauticoro/network_design_tool/blob/main/IntegratedOptimization.ipynb) and open them.
4. The top of the notebook has directions and shows you what to do.  You should only need to manipulate data in the top block of code.
5. Don’t be intimidated by the code– it is easy to follow and get running.
6. To run, go up to the menu item Cell | Run All.  (Don’t hit the run icon, it just runs a block of code).
7. You will see maps that it creates and it dumps some data into the folder where you put the notebook.
8. Rename the scenario everytime to avoid overwriting your files.  Make sure you close files if you are going to overwrite them.

### Acknowledgment
Thanks Michael Watson for proving the idea of building this tool, 
and helping by making available such an amazing book with the scripts of the course material
