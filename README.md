# Infralast | Supply Chain Network Design Tool

Welcome to **Infralast**!

This is an open source tool being designed to support you to 
add more intelligence power into operations wherever you go.

 This tool was created by Bautista Coronado, leveraging in 
 previous programs created by Michael Watson for educational 
 purposes in the book [Supply Chain Network Design](http://networkdesignbook.com/).
 
Infralast, in particular, is a result of our intention of
*Empowering people to make data based decisions through 
the usage of simple tools with low entrance barriers*.

In this github, you will find our main optimization tool: [IntegratedOptimization.ipynb](https://github.com/bauticoro/network_design_tool/blob/main/IntegratedOptimization.ipynb)
And you will find [data folder](https://github.com/bauticoro/network_design_tool/tree/main/data) which stablishes the input data schema to make this tool work. 
It is important not to change the first row of each file, neither the order of the columns.

Contributions and constructive feedback are very welcome. 
Please [Reach out](bauticoro@gmail.com) to us.
